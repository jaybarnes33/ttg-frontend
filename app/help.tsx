          Time To Go (TTG) is an alert app designed for outdoor and water enthusiasts‚Äîlike kayakers,
          paddleboarders, fishermen, and small boat users. TTG monitors wind, wave, and tide
          conditions at user-selected locations and sends a push notification when your saved
          conditions match. Tapping the notification opens a full-screen alert pop-up. A sonar-style
          PING sound plays every 5 seconds until you close the pop-up or hit the "Silence Alert"
          button. No checking. No stress. Just know‚Äîit's Time To Go.
